# My Personal Portfolio Website (Vue 3 + Vite)

*Overview*
- This is a single-page portfolio website built with Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia. The site includes:

- A Home section with a reactive counter and toggleable extra info.

- A Projects section that displays a list of projects and shows the total count.

- A Contact section featuring a form that uses v-model for two-way data binding and a watcher to log changes.

*Features*
- Reactivity & State Management: Uses Vue 3â€™s Composition API (ref, computed, watch) and Pinia for global state where needed.

- Single-Page Navigation: A simple nav bar that scrolls smoothly between the Home, Projects, and Contact sections.

- Conditional Rendering: Uses v-if, v-show, and v-for to manage dynamic UI elements (like the project list and toggled info).

- Form Handling: The Contact form demonstrates two-way data binding (v-model) and watchers that log input changes to the console.

*Responsive Layout:* Basic CSS ensures the site is viewable on desktop and mobile devices.
